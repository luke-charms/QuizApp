# QuizApp

**QuizApp** is an interactive, multiple-choice quiz application deployed using a **three-layer microservice architecture** on **Kubernetes**. Users engage with a web interface to test their knowledge, with all questions managed via a REST API by a separate data access service.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a strict **Data Access Layer pattern** to ensure separation of concerns:

| Layer | Microservice/Component | Role | Communication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presentation** | **QuizApp** (Web UI) | Handles user interaction and displays the quiz. | REST API (to QuizWorker) |
| **Data Access** | **QuizWorker** | Manages question retrieval, addition, and score persistence. | REST API (to QuizApp) |
| **Data Storage** | **MongoDB** | Stores all quiz questions and user score data. | Direct access (by QuizWorker only) |

## Core Functionality

-   **Quiz Taking:**
    -   Accessing the main web UI (`/`) displays a random question from the database.
    -   Users are prompted to select an answer from the multiple-choice options.
-   **Question Management:**
    -   Questions can be added via a dedicated web form (`/addQuestion`).
    -   Alternatively, new questions can be inserted directly using the QuizWorker's REST API.
-   **Score Tracking:**
    -   User scores are reliably **persistent** and maintained across different browser sessions.
-   **REST APIs:**
    -   Both the QuizApp and QuizWorker microservices expose and consume REST APIs for seamless integration and inter-layer communication.
